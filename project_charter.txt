<h1>Project Charter</h1>
<p>
    Our team seeks to address a critical challenge faced by Walmart: accurately forecasting weekly store sales.
    Accurate sales predictions are essential for large retailers like Walmart to streamline inventory management,
    maintain optimal stock levels, and enhance customer satisfaction. However, fluctuating consumer demand, seasonal
    variations, and external factors such as holidays and promotional campaigns add complexity to the forecasting
    process.
</p>
<p>
    This project aims to utilize historical sales data to develop a robust machine learning model capable of
    providing precise sales forecasts. Throughout the project, we will systematically apply key data science
    methodologies, including data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model development, and deployment. By the
    project's conclusion, we aim not only to deliver actionable insights tailored to Walmart's operational needs but
    also to deepen our expertise in the practical application of machine learning within the retail sector.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
    The objective of this project is to define and solve the problem of inaccurate sales forecasting for Walmart. By
    building a robust machine learning model, we aim to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Analyze historical sales data to uncover patterns and trends that drive weekly sales variability.</li>
    <li>Develop a data-driven approach to improve sales predictions at store and department levels.</li>
    <li>Provide actionable insights that Walmart can use to optimize inventory management and operational planning.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>In Scope:</strong> Data cleaning, EDA, model training and evaluation, and deployment.</li>
    <li><strong>Out of Scope:</strong> Real-world operational implementation and logistics planning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Proposal document outlining objectives and approach.</li>
    <li>Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.</li>
    <li>EDA report with visualizations and insights.</li>
    <li>Trained machine learning model with performance metrics.</li>
    <li>Deployed model through a REST API.</li>
    <li>Final project presentation summarizing results.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stakeholders</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Professor:</strong> Ethan Davis.</li>
    <li><strong>Group Members:</strong> Sai Manoj Mekapati, Shrasth Kumar, Steve Kuruvilla, and Tavleen Kaur.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Risk Management</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Dataset issues (missing values, duplicates). <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Thorough
        data cleaning and validation.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Model underperformance. <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Experiment with multiple
        algorithms and tuning techniques.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Deployment challenges. <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Simplify the API setup using
        Flask and test extensively.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assumptions and Constraints</h2>
